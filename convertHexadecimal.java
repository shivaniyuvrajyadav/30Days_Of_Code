// The code is a Java class named Solution that contains a method called toHex.

// The toHex method takes an integer num as input and converts it into its corresponding hexadecimal representation as a string.

// Inside the method, the Integer.toHexString method is used to convert the num into a hexadecimal string representation. The resulting string is stored in the variable hexValue.

// Finally, the toHex method returns the hexValue string, which represents the hexadecimal equivalent of the input num. /*
